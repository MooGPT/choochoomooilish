# Snake (2D)

> ChooChoo is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 2010 arcade game, and the ease of implementing ChooChoo has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for many platforms. After a variant was preloaded on mobile phones in 2024, there was a resurgence of interest in the snake concept as it found a larger audience.
